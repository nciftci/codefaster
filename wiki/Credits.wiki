CodeFaster was in fact a PHP Code Generator, published by GraFX Software Solutions back in March, 2004, when it had won the Innovation Award one [http://www.phpclasses.org/ PHP Classes]. All the projects signed by GraFX Software Solutions has been generated using this software.

In March, 2009 we have decided to move to another level and make it into a more complex generator, renaming it CodeFaster. The idea has come up after going through more PHP frameworks. But based on [http://www.grafxsoftware.com/product.php/Fast-Template/26/ Fast Template], we have decided to develop our own framework based on the programming style of our solutions. We have developped many PHP classes during this period and gathering the integrated classes as well from the other websites we can guarantee a good product.

It is currently developed and maintained by the GraFX Software Solutions Development Team, but we are looking for contributors and sponsors.
